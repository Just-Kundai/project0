### Technologies
* Vanilla JavaScript
* HTML5
* CSS

### Approach

To start off this project I looked up examples of what a Tic Tac Toe Game is supposed to look like as this is not a game I have played with that name before.

Then I began the project following the steps laid out on the Project 0 page on git hub. Once I had the basics of the game working, I decided to add other features.

### Features

* Fully functional game
* Customisable player icons and player names
* Saves player data

### Lessons Learned

Try. Ask for help. Research and importantly know why each line of code is relevant.

### Setup

To run this project, you can download the source code, or see it live at https://just-kundai.github.io/project0/

### Future Additions

* Currently game runs until players are tired, would like to stop after 5 rounds or give players option.
* Would like to allow players to customise windows.
* Would like to make a sound when player wins a game.

### Special Thanks

Rowena and Pat you are awesome.
