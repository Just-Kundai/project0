# Markdown Basics

## Paragraphs

A few simple examples of Markdown.

Paragraphs require only new lines.

So document look good just by hitting Enter.

Underscore _also_ works.

##Code

CloJure uses `seq` a lot.
Single back ticks help with making text look like code.

I might mention `console.log()`.

### Multiline Code


```javascript
const hey = function (){
  console.log('wow');
}
```
